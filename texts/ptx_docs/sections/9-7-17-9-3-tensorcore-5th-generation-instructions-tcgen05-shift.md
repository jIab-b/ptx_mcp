##### 9.7.17.9.3. Tensorcore 5th Generation Instructions: `tcgen05.shift`

`tcgen05.shift`

Asynchronously shift down the rows of the matrix in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) for a warp.

Syntax

```
tcgen05.shift.cta_group.down  [taddr];

.cta_group = { .cta_group::1, .cta_group::2 }
```

Description

Instruction `tcgen05.shift` is an asynchronous instruction which initiates the shifting of 32-byte elements downwards across all the rows, except the last, by one row. The address operand `taddr` specifies the base address of the matrix in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) whose rows must be down shifted.

The lane of the address operand `taddr` must be aligned to 32.

Qualifier `.cta_group` specifies the number of CTAs whose [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) is touched when a single thread of a single CTA executes the `tcgen05.shift` instruction. When `.cta_group::1` is specified, the shift operation is performed in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) of the current CTA. When `.cta_group::2` is specified, the shift operation is performed in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) of both the current and the [peer CTAs](#tcgen05-peer-cta).

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group` qualifier.

PTX ISA Notes
