##### 5.5.3.4.1. Bounding Box

For `Tile::scatter4` and `Tile::gather4` modes, four request coordinates will form four Bounding Boxes in the tensor space.

[Figure 10](#tiled-scatter4-gather4-bounding-box) shows an example of the same with start coordinates (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 0) and (1, 9).

The size of the bounding box in the dimension 0 represents the length of the rows. The size of the bounding box in the dimension 1 must be one.
