##### 9.7.15.5.8. Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k16` with floating point type

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k16` floating point types will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds a fragment of the matrix.

- Multiplicand A:
  - `.f16` and `.bf16` :
    | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `.f16` / `.bf16` | A vector expression containing four `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16` / `.bf16` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |
    
    The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 79](#mma-16816-a-f16).
    
    Figure 79 MMA .m16n8k16 fragment layout for matrix A with `.f16` / `.bf16` type.
    
    The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
    
    ```cpp
    groupID           = %laneid >> 2
    threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4
    
    row =      groupID            for ai where  0 <= i < 2 || 4 <= i < 6
              groupID + 8         Otherwise
    
    col =  (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1)          for ai where i <  4
    (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1) + 8      for ai where i >= 4
    ```
  - `.f64` :
    | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `.f64` | A vector expression containing eight `.f64` registers, with each register containing one `.f64` element from the matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |
    
    The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 80](#mma-16816-a-f64).

    The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
    
    ```cpp
    groupID           = %laneid >> 2
    threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4
    
    row =  groupID                               for ai where  i % 2 = 0
           groupID + 8                           Otherwise
    
    col =  (i * 2) + threadID_in_group           for ai where i % 2 = 0
           (i * 2) - 2 + (threadID_in_group      Otherwise
    ```
- Multiplicand B:
  - `.f16` and `.bf16` :
    | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `.f16` / `.bf16` | A vector expression containing two `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16` / `.bf16` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3 |
    
    The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 81](#mma-16816-b-f16).

    ```cpp
    groupID           = %laneid >> 2
    threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4
    
    row =  (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1)           for bi where i <  2
           (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1) + 8       for bi where i >= 2
    
    col = groupID
    ```

    | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | `.f64` | A vector expression containing four `.f64` registers, with each register containing one `.f64` element from the matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3 |

    row =  threadID_in_group + (i * 4)           for bi where  i < 4
    
    col =  groupID
    ```
- Accumulators (C or D): The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 83](#mma-16816-c). The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
  .ctype / .dtype
