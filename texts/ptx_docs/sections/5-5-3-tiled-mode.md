### 5.5.3. Tiled Mode 

This section talks about how Tensor and Tensor access work in tiled mode.

#### 5.5.3.1. [Bounding Box](#tensor-tiled-mode-bounding-box)[](#tensor-tiled-mode-bounding-box "Permalink to this headline")

A tensor can be accessed in chunks known as *Bounding Box*. The Bounding Box has the same
dimensionality as the tensor they are accessing into. Size of each bounding Box must be a multiple
of 16 bytes. The address of the bounding Box must also be aligned to 16 bytes.

Bounding Box has the following access properties:

* Bounding Box dimension sizes
* Out of boundary access mode
* Traversal strides

The tensor-coordinates, specified in the PTX tensor instructions, specify the starting offset of the
bounding box. Starting offset of the bounding box along with the rest of the bounding box
information together are used to determine the elements which are to be accessed.

#### 5.5.3.2. [Traversal-Stride](#tensor-tiled-mode-traversal-stride)[](#tensor-tiled-mode-traversal-stride "Permalink to this headline")

While the Bounding Box is iterating the tensor across a dimension, the traversal stride specifies
the exact number of elements to be skipped. If no jump over is required, default value of 1 must be
specified.

The traversal stride in dimension 0 can be used for the [Interleave layout](#tensor-interleaved-layout).
For non-interleaved layout, the traversal stride in
dimension 0 must always be 1.

[Figure 8](#tensor-tiled-mode-bb-example) illustrates tensor, tensor size, tensor stride,
Bounding Box size and traversal stride.

#### 5.5.3.3. [Out of Boundary Access](#tensor-tiled-mode-oob-access)[](#tensor-tiled-mode-oob-access "Permalink to this headline")

PTX Tensor operation can detect and handle the case when the Bounding Box crosses the tensor
boundary in any dimension. There are 2 modes:

* Zero fill mode:

  Elements in the Bounding Box which fall outside of the tensor boundary are set to 0.
* `OOB-NaN` fill mode:

  Elements in the Bounding Box which fall outside of the tensor boundary are set to a special NaN
  called `OOB-NaN`.

[Figure 9](#tensor-oob-access) shows an example of the out of boundary access.

#### 5.5.3.4. [`.tile::scatter4` and `.tile::gather4` modes](#tensor-tiled-scatter4-gather4-modes)[](#tensor-tiled-scatter4-gather4-modes "Permalink to this headline")

These modes are similar to the tiled mode with restriction that these modes work only on 2D tensor data.
`Tile::scatter4` and `Tile::gather4` modes are used to access multiple non-contiguous rows of tensor data.

In `Tile::scatter4` mode single 2D source tensor is divided into four rows in the 2D destination tensor.
In `Tile::gather4` mode four rows in the source 2D tensor are combined to form single 2D destination tensor.

These modes work on four rows and hence the instruction will take:

1. four tensor coordinates across the dimension 0
2. one tensor coordinate across the dimension 1

The interleave layout is not supported for `.tile::scatter4` and `.tile::gather4` modes.

All other constraints and rules of the tile mode apply to these modes as well.

##### 5.5.3.4.1. [Bounding Box](#tensor-tiled-scatter4-gather4-modes-bounding-box)[](#tensor-tiled-scatter4-gather4-modes-bounding-box "Permalink to this headline")

For `Tile::scatter4` and `Tile::gather4` modes, four request coordinates will form four Bounding
Boxes in the tensor space.

[Figure 10](#tiled-scatter4-gather4-bounding-box) shows an example of the same with start
coordinates (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 0) and (1, 9).

The size of the bounding box in the dimension 0 represents the length of the rows.
The size of the bounding box in the dimension 1 must be one.
