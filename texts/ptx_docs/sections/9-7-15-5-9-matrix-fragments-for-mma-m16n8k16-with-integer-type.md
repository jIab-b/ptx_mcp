##### 9.7.15.5.9. Matrix Fragments for `mma.m16n8k16` with integer type

A warp executing `mma.m16n8k16` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds a fragment of the matrix.

- Multiplicand A: The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 84](#mma-16816-a-i8). The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
  .atype
  
  Fragment
  
  Elements (low to high)
  
  `.u8` / `.s8`
  
  A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing four `.u8` / `.s8` elements from the matrix A.
  
  a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7
  
  `.e4m3` / `.e5m2`
  
  A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing four `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` elements from the matrix A.
  
  a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4
  
  row =      groupID                            for ai where i < 4
           groupID + 8                          for ai where i >= 4
  
  col =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + (i & 0x3)    for ai where i = {0,..,7}
  ```
- Multiplicand B: The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 85](#mma-16816-b-i8). The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
  .btype
  
  Fragment
  
  Elements (low to high)
  
  `.u8` / `.s8`
  
  A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.u8` / `.s8` elements from the matrix B.
  
  b0, b1, b2, b3
  
  `.e4m3` / `.e5m2`
  
  A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing four `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` elements from the matrix B.
  
  b0, b1. b2. b3

  ```
  groupID           = %laneid >> 2
  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4
  
  row =  (threadID_in_group * 4) + i         for bi where i = {0,..,3}
  
  col = groupID
  ```
- Accumulators (C or D): The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 86](#mma-16816-c-i8). The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:
  .ctype / .dtype
  
  Fragment
  
  Elements (low to high)
  
  `.s32`
  
  A vector expression containing four `.s32` registers, containing four `.s32` elements from the matrix C (or D).
  
  c0, c1, c2, c3
  
  `.f32`
  
  A vector expression containing four `.f32` registers, containing four `.f32` elements from the matrix C (or D).
  
  c0, c1, c2, c3
  
  `.f16`
  
  A vector expression containing two `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16` elements from the matrix C (or D).
  
  c0, c1, c1, c2

           groupID + 8                         for ci where i >= 2
  
  col =  (threadID_in_group * 2) + (i & 0x1)    for ci where i = {0,..,3}
