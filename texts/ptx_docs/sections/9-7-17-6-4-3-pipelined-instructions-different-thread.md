###### 9.7.17.6.4.3. Pipelined instructions, different thread

In this pattern, no explicit waiting mechanism is needed but proper synchronization between threads is needed.

Example:

| Thread 0 | Thread 1 |
| --- | --- |
| tcgen05.cp tcgen05.fence::before_thread_sync mbarrier.arrive.relaxed.cluster |  |
|  | mbarrier.try_wait.relaxed.cluster // loop till success tcgen05.fence::after_thread_sync tcgen05.mma |
