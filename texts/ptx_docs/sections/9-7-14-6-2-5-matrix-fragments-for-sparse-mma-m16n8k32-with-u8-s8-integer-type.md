###### 9.7.14.6.2.5. Matrix Fragments for sparse mma.m16n8k32 with .u8 / .s8 integer type 

A warp executing sparse `mma.m16n8k32` with `.u8` / `.s8` integer type will compute an MMA
operation of shape `.m16n8k32`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u8` / `.s8` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing four non-zero `.u8` / `.s8` elements out of 8 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#warp-level-sparse-matrix-storage). |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 128](#sparse-mma-16832-u8s8-a).

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2

  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4



  row = groupID for ai where 0 <= i < 4

   groupID + 8 Otherwise



  col = [firstcol ... lastcol] // As per the mapping of non-zero elements

   // as described in Sparse matrix storage



  Where

  firstcol = threadID_in_group * 8

  lastcol = firstcol + 7
  ```
* Matrix fragments for multiplicand B and accumulators C and D are the same as in case of
  [Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k32](#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16832).
* Metadata: A `.b32` register containing 16 2-bit vectors with each pair of 2-bit vectors storing
  the indices of two non-zero elements from a 4-wide chunk of matrix A as shown in
  [Figure 129](#sparse-mma-metadata-16832-u8s8).
