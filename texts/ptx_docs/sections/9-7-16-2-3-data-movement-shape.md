##### 9.7.16.2.3. Data Movement Shape 

The data movement shape indicates the dimension of the data to be moved to or from the
[Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). These shapes are described as a tuple `lane x size` where:

* `lane` indicates the number of rows in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory); and
* `size` indicates the amount of data, in units of bits (b), across the columns in the
  [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory).

The following shapes are supported by various tcgen05 operations:

| Shape | tcgen05.<op> |
| --- | --- |
| `.16x64b`, `.16x128b`, `.16x256b`, `.16x32bx2`, `.32x32b` | `.ld` / `.st` |
| `.4x256b`, `.32x128b`, `.64x128b`, `.128x256b`, `.128x128b` | `.cp` |
| `.31x256b` (implicit) | `.shift` |

A `tcgen05{.ld,.st}.32x32b` instruction has the following data vector register.

| Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
| --- | --- |
| A vector expression containing `.num` number of `.b32` registers as mentioned in the [Table 47](#tcgen05-num-shapes-ld). | r0, r1, … |

A warp executing `tcgen05{.ld,.st}.32x32b` will access 32 lanes of the Tensor Memory.
It loads from or stores to each of the lane (32 \* .num)-bits of data as shown in
[Figure 183](#tcgen05-mma-fragment-3232b).
