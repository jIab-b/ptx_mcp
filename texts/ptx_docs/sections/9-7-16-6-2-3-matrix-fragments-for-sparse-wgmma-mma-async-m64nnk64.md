###### 9.7.16.6.2.3. Matrix Fragments for sparse `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk64`

A warpgroup executing sparse `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk64` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m64nNk64` where N is a valid n dimension as listed in [Matrix Shape](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shape).

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warpgroup so each thread of the warpgroup holds a fragment of the matrix.

- Multiplicand A, from shared memory is documented in [Matrix Fragments for sparse wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk64](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-wgmma-64n64).
- Multiplicand A, from registers:
  | .atype | Fragments | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.e4m3` / `.e5m2` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing four non-zero `.e4m3` /`.e5m2` elements out of eight consecutive elements from matrix A. | Non-zero elements: a0, a1, a2, â¦ , a15 Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-sparse-matrix-storage) |
  | `.s8` / `.u8` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing four non-zero `.s8` /`.u8` elements out of eight consecutive elements from matrix A. | Non-zero elements: a0, a1, a2, â¦ , a15 Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-sparse-matrix-storage) |
  
  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 179](#sparse-wgmma-64n64-e4m3-e5m2-s8-u8-a).

- Accumulator D: Matrix fragments for accumulator D are the same as in case of [Matrix Fragments for wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk32](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-register-fragment-wgmma-64n32) for the same `.dtype` format.
- Multiplicand B: Shared memory layout for Matrix B is documented in [Matrix Fragments for sparse wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk64](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-wgmma-64n64).
- Metadata operand is a `.b32` register containing 16 4-bit vectors each storing the indices of two non-zero elements of a 4-wide chunk of matrix A. [Figure 180](#sparse-wgmma-metadata-64n64-e4m3-e5m2-s8-u8-first32col) shows the mapping of the metadata bits to the elements of columns 0â31 of matrix A. [Figure 181](#sparse-wgmma-metadata-64n64-e4m3-e5m2-s8-u8-last32col) shows the mapping of the metadata bits to the elements of columns 32â63 of matrix A.
