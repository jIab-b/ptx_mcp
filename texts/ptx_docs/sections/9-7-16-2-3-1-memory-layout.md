A `tcgen05{.ld,.st}.32x32b` instruction has the following data vector register.

| Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
| --- | --- |
| A vector expression containing `.num` number of `.b32` registers as mentioned in the [Table 47](#tcgen05-num-shapes-ld). | r0, r1, … |

A warp executing `tcgen05{.ld,.st}.32x32b` will access 32 lanes of the Tensor Memory.
It loads from or stores to each of the lane (32 \* .num)-bits of data as shown in
[Figure 183](#tcgen05-mma-fragment-3232b).
