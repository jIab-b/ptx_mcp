### 8.10.3. Atomicity

Single-Copy Atomicity

Conflicting *morally strong* operations are performed with *single-copy atomicity*. When a read R and a write W are *morally strong*, then the following two communications cannot both exist in the same execution, for the set of bytes accessed by both R and W:

1. R reads any byte from W.
2. R reads any byte from any write Wâ which precedes W in *coherence order*.

Atomicity of read-modify-write (RMW) operations

When an *atomic* operation A and a write W *overlap* and are *morally strong*, then the following two communications cannot both exist in the same execution, for the set of bytes accessed by both A and W:

1. A reads any byte from a write Wâ that precedes W in *coherence order*.
2. A follows W in *coherence order*.

Litmus Test 1

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| .global .u32 x = 0; | .global .u32 x = 0; |
| T1 | T2 |
| A1: atom.sys.inc.u32 %r0, [x]; | A2: atom.sys.inc.u32 %r0, [x]; |
| FINAL STATE: x == 2 | FINAL STATE: x == 2 |

Atomicity is guaranteed when the operations are *morally strong*.

Litmus Test 2

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| .global .u32 x = 0; | .global .u32 x = 0; |
| T1 | T2 (In a different CTA) |
| A1: atom.cta.inc.u32 %r0, [x]; | A2: atom.gpu.inc.u32 %r0, [x]; |
| FINAL STATE: x == 1 OR x == 2 | FINAL STATE: x == 1 OR x == 2 |

Atomicity is not guaranteed if the operations are not *morally strong*.
