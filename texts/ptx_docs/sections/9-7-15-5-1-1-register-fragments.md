This section describes the organization of various matrices located in register operands of the
`wgmma.mma_async` instruction.

###### 9.7.15.5.1.1.1. [Matrix Fragments for `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk16`](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-register-fragment-wgmma-64n16)[](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-register-fragment-wgmma-64n16 "Permalink to this headline")

A warpgroup executing `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk16` will compute an MMA operation of shape
`.m64nNk16` where N is a valid `n` dimension as listed in
[Matrix Shape](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shape).

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warpgroup so each thread of the
warpgroup holds a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A in registers:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f16`/`.bf16` | A vector expression containing four `.f16x2` registers, with each register containing two `.f16`/ `.bf16` elements from matrix A. | a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 148](#wgmma-64n16-a).
