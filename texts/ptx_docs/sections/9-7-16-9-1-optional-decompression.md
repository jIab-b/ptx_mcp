##### 9.7.16.9.1. Optional Decompression 

Optionally, during the copy, a vector of 4-bit and 6-bit
custom floating point types can be decompressed into 8-bit types.

A contiguous set of 16 elements of 4-bits each followed by 8 bytes of padding can be converted
into 16 elements of 8-bits each as shown in [Figure 194](#tcgen05-decompression-4b8b).

The individual 4-bit to 8-bit decompression would look like as shown in [Figure 195](#tcgen05-decompression-4b8b-individual).

A contiguous set of 16 elements of 6-bits each followed by 4 bytes of padding is
decompressed into 16 elements of 8-bits each as shown in [Figure 196](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b).

The individual 6-bit to 8-bit decompression for types `E3M2` and `E2M3` is shown in
[Figure 197](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b-individual1) and [Figure 198](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b-individual2)
respectively.
