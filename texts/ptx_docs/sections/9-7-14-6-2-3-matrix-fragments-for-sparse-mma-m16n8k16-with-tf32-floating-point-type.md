###### 9.7.14.6.2.3. Matrix Fragments for sparse mma.m16n8k16 with .tf32 floating point type 

A warp executing sparse `mma.m16n8k16` with `.tf32` floating point type will compute an MMA
operation of shape `.m16n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.tf32` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing one non-zero `.tf32` element out of 2 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#warp-level-sparse-matrix-storage). |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 123](#sparse-mma-16816-tf32-a).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2

  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4



  row = groupID for a0 and a2

   groupID + 8 for a1 and a3



  col = [firstcol ... lastcol] // As per the mapping of non-zero elements

   // as described in Sparse matrix storage



  Where

  firstcol = threadID_in_group * 2 for a0 and a1

   (threadID_in_group * 2) + 8 for a2 and a3

  lastcol = firstcol + 1
  ```
* Multiplicand B:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.tf32` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, each containing four `.tf32` elements from matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 124](#sparse-mma-16816-tf32-b).

* Matrix fragments for accumulators C and D are the same as in case of
  [Matrix Fragments for mma.m16n8k16 with floating point type](#warp-level-matrix-fragment-mma-16816-float).
* Metadata: A `.b32` register containing 8 4-bit vectors each storing the index of a non-zero
  element of a 2-wide chunk of matrix A as shown in [Figure 125](#sparse-mma-metadata-16816-tf32).
