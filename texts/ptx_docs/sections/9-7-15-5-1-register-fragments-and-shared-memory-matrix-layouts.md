##### 9.7.15.5.1. Register Fragments and Shared Memory Matrix Layouts 

The input matrix A of the warpgroup wide MMA operations can be either in registers or in the shared
memory. The input matrix B of the warpgroup wide MMA operations must be in the shared memory. This
section describes the layouts of register fragments and shared memory expected by the warpgroup MMA
instructions.

When the matrices are in shared memory, their starting addresses must be aligned to 16 bytes.

This section describes the organization of various matrices located in register operands of the
`wgmma.mma_async` instruction.

A warpgroup executing `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk16` will compute an MMA operation of shape
`.m64nNk16` where N is a valid `n` dimension as listed in
[Matrix Shape](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shape).

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warpgroup so each thread of the
warpgroup holds a fragment of the matrix.

###### 9.7.15.5.1.2. [Shared Memory Matrix Layout](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout)[](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout "Permalink to this headline")

If the argument `imm-trans-a` / `imm-trans-b` of the instruction `wgmma.mma_async{.sp}`
is 0, then *K-major* is used for matrix `A` / `B` respectively. If the value of argument
`imm-trans-a` is 1 then *M-major* is used for matrix `A`. If the value of the argument
`imm-trans-b` is 1, then *N-major* is used for matrix `B`.

In a column-major default BLAS library such as cuBLAS, the matrices `A` and `B` with and
without transpose can be classified as either *K-Major* or *M-or-N-Major* as shown in the
following table:

|  | Non-Transposed | Transposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | K-major | M-major |
| B | K-major | N-major |

To avoid confusion with `A`, `B`, `row-major`, `col-major`, `transpose`, and
`non-transpose`, we will use *MN-Major* and *K-Major* throughout this section.

The matrices in the shared memory are made up of one or more “swizzle layout atom”.
The exact layout of these swizzle atoms depends on the swizzling mode, swizzle-atomicity,
and the leading dimension. The layout of the swizzle are shown in
[Table 38](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-swizzle-lead-dim).

Table 38 Various combinations of swizzling mode, leading dimension and swizzle-atom layout[](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-swizzle-lead-dim "Permalink to this table")





| Swizzling mode | Leading Dimension / Major-ness | Swizzle atom layout (128b element) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 128B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 8x8 |
| K | 8x8 |
| 64B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 4x8 |
| K | 8x4 |
| 32B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 2x8 |
| K | 8x2 |
| None | M/N | 1x8 |
| K | 8x1 |

The above shapes are for elements of size 128 bits. For smaller elements sizes, the same
shapes would get multiplied along the leading dimension by a factor of `128/sizeof_bits(Element)`.
For example, 128B MN major swizzle atom would have a shape of `(8*(128/32))x8 = 32x8` for
`tf32` tensor core inputs.

The following are some example layouts of *MxK* or *KxN* matrices with various swizzling modes,
and are in units of 128b elements as shown

There are two strides involved while accessing a matrix from shared memory:

2. Stride dimension byte offset

The leading dimension byte offset is defined differently for transposed and non-transposed
matrices. The leading byte offset is defined as follows for matrices whose element types are
normalized to 128-bits:

| Major-ness | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| K-Major | * No-Swizzling: the offset from the first column to the second columns   of the 8x2 tile in the 128-bit element type normalized matrix. * Swizzled layouts: not used, assumed to be 1. |
| MN-Major | * Interleave: offset from the first 8 columns to the next 8 columns. * Swizzled layouts: offset from the first (swizzle-byte-size/16) rows   to the next (swizzle-byte-size/16) rows. |

matrices. The stride dimension byte offset is defined as follows for matrices whose element

###### 9.7.15.5.1.2.2. [Matrix Descriptor Format](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout-matrix-descriptor)[](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout-matrix-descriptor "Permalink to this headline")

Matrix descriptor specifies the properties of the matrix in shared memory that is a multiplicand in
the matrix multiply and accumulate operation. It is a 64-bit value contained in a register with the
following layout:

| Bit-field | Size in bits | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13–0 | 14 | matrix-descriptor-encode(Matrix start address) |
| 29–16 | 14 | matrix-descriptor-encode ([Leading dimension byte offset](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-leading-dimension-byte-offset)) |
| 45–32 | 14 | matrix-descriptor-encode ([Stride dimension byte offset](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-stride-dimension-byte-offset)) |
| 51–49 | 3 | Matrix base offset. This is valid for all swizzling modes except the no-swizzle mode. |
| 63–62 | 2 | Specifies the swizzling mode to be used:   * 0: No swizzle * 1: 128-Byte swizzle * 2: 64-Byte swizzle * 3: 32-Byte swizzle |

where

```
matrix-descriptor-encode(x) = (x & 0x3FFFF) >> 4
```

The value of base offset is 0 when the repeating pattern of the specified swizzling mode starts as
per the below table:

> | Swizzling mode | Starting address of the repeating pattern |
> | --- | --- |
> | 128-Byte swizzle | 1024-Byte boundary |
> | 64-Byte swizzle | 512-Byte boundary |
> | 32-Byte swizzle | 256-Byte boundary |

Otherwise, the base offset must be a non-zero value, computed using the following formula:

```
base offset = (pattern start addr >> 0x7) & 0x7
```
