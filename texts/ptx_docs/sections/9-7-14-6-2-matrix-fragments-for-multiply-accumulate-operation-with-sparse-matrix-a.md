##### 9.7.14.6.2. Matrix fragments for multiply-accumulate operation with sparse matrix A 

In this section we describe how the contents of thread registers are associated with fragments of
various matrices and the sparsity metadata. The following conventions are used throughout this
section:

* For matrix A, only the layout of a fragment is described in terms of register vector sizes and
  their association with the matrix data.
* For matrix B, when the combination of matrix dimension and the supported data type is not already
  covered in [Matrix multiply-accumulate operation using mma instruction](#warp-level-matrix-instructions-for-mma), a pictorial representation of matrix
  fragments is provided.
* For matrices C and D, since the matrix dimension - data type combination is the same for all
  supported shapes, and is already covered in
  [Matrix multiply-accumulate operation using mma instruction](#warp-level-matrix-instructions-for-mma), the pictorial representations
  of matrix fragments are not included in this section.
* For the metadata operand, pictorial representations of the association between indices of the
  elements of matrix A and the contents of the metadata operand are included. `Tk: [m..n]` present
  in cell `[x][y..z]` indicates that bits `m` through `n` (with `m` being higher) in the
  metadata operand of thread with `%laneid=k` contains the indices of the non-zero elements from
  the chunk `[x][y]..[x][z]` of matrix A.

A warp executing sparse `mma.m16n8k16` with `.f16` / `.bf16` floating point type will compute
an MMA operation of shape `.m16n8k16`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f16` / `.bf16` | A vector expression containing two `.b32` registers, with each register containing two non-zero `.f16` / `.bf16` elements out of 4 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#warp-level-sparse-matrix-storage). |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 118](#sparse-mma-16816-f16-bf16-a).

   // as described in Sparse matrix storage



  Where

  firstcol = threadID_in_group * 4

  ```

###### 9.7.14.6.2.8. [Matrix Fragments for sparse `mma.m16n8k128` with `.u4` / `.s4` integer type](#warp-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-mma-168128-u4s4)[](#warp-level-matrix-fragment-sparse-mma-168128-u4s4 "Permalink to this headline")

A warp executing sparse `mma.m16n8k128` with `.u4` / `.s4` / `.e2m1` integer type will compute an MMA
operation of shape `.m16n8k128`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u4` / `.s4` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight non-zero `.u4` / `.s4` elements out of 16 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#warp-level-sparse-matrix-storage). |
  | `.e2m1` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing eight non-zero `.e2m1` elements out of 16 consecutive elements from matrix A. |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 140](#sparse-mma-168128-u4s4-a-first64col)
  and [Figure 141](#sparse-mma-168128-u4s4-a-last64col).

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2

  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4



  row = groupID for ai where 0 <= i < 8 || 16 <= i < 24

   groupID + 8 Otherwise



  col = [firstcol ... lastcol] // As per the mapping of non-zero elements

   // as described in Sparse matrix storage



  Where

  firstcol = threadID_in_group * 16 For ai where i < 16

   (threadID_in_group * 16) + 64 For ai where i >= 16

  lastcol = firstcol + 15
  ```
* Multiplicand B:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.u4` / `.s4` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, each containing eight `.u4` / `.s4` elements from matrix B. | b0, b1, b2, b3, …, b31 |
  | `.e2m1` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, each containing eight `.e2m1` elements from matrix B. |
