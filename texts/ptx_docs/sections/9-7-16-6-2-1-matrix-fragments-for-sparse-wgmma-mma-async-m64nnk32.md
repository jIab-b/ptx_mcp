###### 9.7.16.6.2.1. Matrix Fragments for sparse `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk32`

A warpgroup executing sparse `wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk32` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m64nNk32` where N is a valid n dimension as listed in [Matrix Shape](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shape).

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warpgroup so each thread of the warpgroup holds a fragment of the matrix.

- Multiplicand A, from shared memory is documented in [Shared Memory Matrix Layout](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout).
- Multiplicand A, from registers:
  | .atype | Fragments | Elements |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.f16` / `.bf16` | A vector expression containing four `.b32` registers, with each register containing two non-zero `.f16` /`.bf16` elements out of 4 consecutive elements from matrix A. | Non-zero elements: a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 Mapping of the non-zero elements is as described in [Sparse matrix storage](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-sparse-matrix-storage) |
  
  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 175](#sparse-wgmma-64n32-f16-bf16-a).

- Accumulator D: Matrix fragments for accumulator D are the same as in case of [Matrix Fragments for wgmma.mma_async.m64nNk32](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-register-fragment-wgmma-64n32) for the same `.dtype` format.
- Multiplicand B: Shared memory layout for Matrix B is documented in [Shared Memory Matrix Layout](#asynchronous-warpgroup-level-matrix-shared-memory-layout).
- Metadata operand is a `.b32` register containing 16 2-bit vectors each storing the index of a non-zero element of a 4-wide chunk of matrix A. [Figure 176](#sparse-wgmma-metadata-64n32-f16bf16) shows the mapping of the metadata bits to the elements of matrix A for a warp. In this figure, variable `i` represents the value of the sparsity selector operand.
