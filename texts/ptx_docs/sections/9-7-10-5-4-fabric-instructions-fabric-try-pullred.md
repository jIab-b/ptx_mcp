Description

Initiates asynchronous loads from multiple resources pointed to by multicast fabric handle `[srcLeId, srcDataOff]`, of `size` bytes, and performs element-wise reduction on data across each of the loads. The result is stored in `[dst, dst + size - 1]`. `srcLeId` is a 32-bit unsigned value denoting the logical endpoint identifier, and `srcDataOff` is a 64-bit unsigned value denoting the base offset of the resources to access within the multicast logical endpoint associated with `srcLeId`.

The `size` operand is 32 bits and specifies the number of bytes to be copied. It must be a multiple of 16; otherwise, the behavior is undefined. The destination range `[dst, dst + size - 1]` must be in bounds of the destination memory space. The source range `[srcDataOff, srcDataOff + size - 1]` must be in bounds of the logical endpoint associated with `srcLeId` on the current device.

The destination pointer `dst` and the source handle offset `srcDataOff` must be 16-byte aligned.

A reduction is performed on the values read from all resources referred to by the multicast logical endpoint. The `.redOp*` modifiers specify the reduction operation. The `.type*` modifiers specify the type of each data element in the source arrays.

The `srcLeId` operand must be associated with a multicast logical endpoint with pull-reduction support, and the device that issues the operation must be a member of the multicast endpoint.

If `.dst` is `.shared::cta`, then the destination `[dst]` and the barrier `[bar]` refer to the local CTAâs shared memory.

The `mbarrier` object `bar` must be initialized with `.layout::v1` (see [Layouts of the mbarrier object](#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-object-layout)). Qualifier `.mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes` specifies that the complete-tx operation is performed on `bar` with completion count equal to the number of bytes copied. For any thread to observe completion of fabric operations via an `mbarrier` object, the issuing thread is required to submit those operations before the barrier phase tracking these operations advances.

Refer to [Fabric Reporting Mechanism](#fabric-reporting-mechanism) for the description of `.mbarrier::report::fabric`.

This instruction accesses data at the locations specified by the handle operands through the fabric-proxy, accesses the destination `.shared::cta` through the async-proxy, and updates the `mbarrier` object in `.shared::cta` through the generic-proxy.

The completion of this operation may be observed by waiting at the barrier via *CTA-scope* operations. Threads must submit `fabric` operations and wait for their completion before grid exit; otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This operation has `.relaxed.sys` memory-order semantics as described in the [Memory Consistency Model](#memory-consistency-model).

The `.sync` qualifier indicates that this instruction causes the issuing thread to wait until warp lanes selected in `imm-membermask` execute this instruction with the same operand values. The behavior is undefined if:

- while a thread is waiting, a warp lane selected in `imm-membermask` executes this instruction with different operand values, or
- any thread selected in `imm-membermask` has exited, or
- the value of `imm-membermask` is not the immediate `0xFFFFFFFF`.
