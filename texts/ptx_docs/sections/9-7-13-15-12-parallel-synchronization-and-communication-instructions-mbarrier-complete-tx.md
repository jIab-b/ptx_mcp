##### 9.7.13.15.12. Parallel Synchronization and Communication Instructions: mbarrier.complete_tx 

`mbarrier.complete_tx`

Perfoms
[complete-tx](#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
operation on the *mbarrier object*.

Syntax

```
mbarrier.complete_tx{.sem}{.scope}{.space}.b64 [addr], txCount;



.sem   = { .relaxed }

.scope = { .cta, .cluster }

.space = { .shared{::cta}, .shared::cluster }
```

Description

A thread executing `mbarrier.complete_tx` performs a [complete-tx](#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-complete-tx-operation)
operation on the *mbarrier object* at the location specified by the address operand `addr`. The
32-bit unsigned integer operand `txCount` specifies the `completeCount` argument to the
*complete-tx* operation.

`mbarrier.complete_tx` does not involve any asynchronous memory operations and only simulates the
completion of an asynchronous memory operation and its side effect of signaling to the *mbarrier
object*.

If no state space is specified then [Generic Addressing](#generic-addressing) is
used. If the address specified by `addr` does not fall within the address window of
`.shared::cta` or `.shared::cluster` state space then the behavior is undefined.

Supported addressing modes for operand `addr` are as described in [Addresses as Operands](#addresses-as-operands).
Alignment for operand `addr` is as described in the
[Size and alignment of mbarrier object](#parallel-synchronization-and-communication-instructions-mbarrier-size-alignment).

This operation does not provide any memory ordering semantics and thus is a *relaxed* operation.
