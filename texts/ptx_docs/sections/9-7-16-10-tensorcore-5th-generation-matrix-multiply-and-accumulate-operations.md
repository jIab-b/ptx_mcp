#### 9.7.16.10. TensorCore 5th Generation Matrix Multiply and accumulate Operations 

The 5th generation of TensorCore operations of shape *MxNxK* perform matrix
multiplication and accumulation of the form:

`D = A*B+D`

where:

* the `A` matrix has shape *MxK*, in either Tensor Memory or Shared Memory
* the `B` matrix has shape *KxN*, in Shared Memory of the current CTA and optionally in peer CTA
* the `D` matrix is of the shape *MxN*, in Tensor Memory

Optionally an input predicate can be used to disable the input from the accumulator
matrix and the following operation can be performed as

`D = A*B`

The matrix multiplication and accumulation operations are categorized into various kinds
based on input types and the throughput of the multiplication operation. The following shows the
different kinds of MMA operations that are supported:

1. `f16` : supports `f16` and `bf16` input types.
2. `tf32` : supports `tf32` input types.
3. `f8f6f4` : supports all input combinations of `f8`, `f6` and `f4` types.
4. `i8` : supports signed and unsigned 8-bit integer input types.
5. `mxf8f6f4`/`mxf4` : supports mx-floating points input types.
6. `mxf4nvf4` : supports `mxf4` type and a custom NVIDIA floating-point
   type for inputs where the type of the vector elements is 4 bits and requires a common
   scaling factor to form the complete floating-point type, similar to other mx-types.

Optionally, the 5th generation of TensorCore MMAs support dense and sparse matrix `A`.
[Sparse Matrices](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices) describes the details of the sparse matrices.

Some of the MMA-kinds requires scaling of input matrices from memory to form the matrix
`A` and matrix `B` before performing the MMA operation.
[Block Scaling](#tcgen05-block-scaling) describes the details of the scaling of matrices.

The following table show the various matrices involved in the MMA operations and the memory in
which they can reside:

| Matrix Type | Memory |
| --- | --- |
| `A` | Tensor Memory OR Shared Memory |
| `B` | Shared Memory |
| `D` | Tensor Memory |
| `Sparse Meta Data` |
| `A-Scale` / `B-Scale` |

A sequence of MMA instructions may reuse the same `A` matrix with a sequence of `B`
matrices or may reuse the same `B` matrix with a sequence of `A` matrices.
In these patterns the TensorCore may be able to laod the unchanged matrix once and reuse
it through the sequence without multiple reloads. The `A` or `B` matrices are loaded
into a TensorCore collector buffer (i.e., special cache).

An MMA instruction has an optional `collector` qualifier to specify when an `A` or `B`
matrix is new to the sequence and should be loaded, unchanged within the sequence
and should be reused, or the last use in the sequence and should be discarded.
The `collector` qualifier is used to give the TensorCore permission to reuse a previously
loaded `A` or `B` matrix; however reuse is opportunistic in that the TensorCore may
reload a matrix even when it has permission to reuse that matrix. Thus, the source
memory of an `A` or `B` matrix must not be modified while the MMA instruction using those
matrices has not completed - regardless of `collector` qualifier permissions.

The 5th generation of TensorCore MMAs can be used for general matrix multiplication OR for
convolution operations. In case of convolutions, the activations can be stored in either
matrix `A` or matrix `B` while the weights will be stored in the other matrix.

| Activation Matrix | Weights Matrix | Name of the op | Instruction Name | Collector Buffer Applicability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `A` | `B` | Activation Stationary | (default `tcgen05.mma`) | Collector buffer is applicable on matrix `A` |
| `B` | `A` | Weights Stationary | `.ws` | Collector buffer is applicable on matrix `B` |

##### 9.7.16.10.1. [Transpose and Negate operations](#tcgen05-transpose-and-negate-operations)[](#tcgen05-transpose-and-negate-operations "Permalink to this headline")

The matrices `A` and `B` can be transposed by specifying the Tranpose `A` Matrix
and Transpose `B` Matrix bits in the instruction descriptor respectively.

The elements of the matrices `A` and `B` can be negated by specifying the Negate
`A` Matrix and Negate `B` Matrix bits in the instruction descriptor respectively.

The support for Transpose and Negate operation for various MMA-Kind are shown in
[Table 49](#tcgen05-transpose-negate-mma-kind).

Table 49 Transpose and Negate operation for various MMA-Kind[](#tcgen05-transpose-negate-mma-kind "Permalink to this table")





| MMA-Kind | Is Transpose A/B supported | Is Negate A/B supported |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.kind::tf32` | Yes | Yes |
| `.kind::f16` | Yes | Yes |
| `.kind::f8f6f4` | Yes | Yes |
| `.kind::mxf8f6f4` | Yes | Yes |
| `.kind::i8` | Yes | No |
| `.kind::mxf4` | No | Yes |
| `.kind::mxf4nvf4` | No | Yes |

For `.kind::tf32`, the transpose operations on matrices `A` and `B` are supported
only with 128B swizzling mode with 32B swizzle-atomicity.

For all other MMA-Kinds, the transpose operations on matrices `A` and `B` are not supported
on 128B swizzling mode with 32B swizzle-atomicity.

###### 9.7.16.10.4.1. [Packing format for matrix D in Tensor Memory](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mat-d)[](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mat-d "Permalink to this headline")

The sub-word elements of matrix `D` are expected not to be packed within a 32-bit Tensor Memory word.
For example, if the type of elements of the matrix `D` is 16 bits then a Tensor Memory word
would contain a single 16-bit element in its lower 16 bits.

###### 9.7.16.10.4.2. [Packing format for matrix A and B](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mat-a-b)[](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mat-a-b "Permalink to this headline")

The 6-bit and 4-bit floating point types have different packing format requirements for
different MMA kinds in both Tensor memory and Shared memory. The requirements are as follows.

###### 9.7.16.10.4.3. [Packing format used for matrix A by `.kind::mxf8f6f4` in Tensor Memory](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mxf8f6f4-tmem)[](#tcgen05-packing-formats-mxf8f6f4-tmem "Permalink to this headline")

The individual 4-bit and the 6-bit floating point type elements must be packed in an 8-bit container
in Tensor memory as shown below. The 8-bit containers must be contiguously packed in a 32-bit Tensor
Memory word. For example, if the type of elements of the matrix `A` is 6 bits then 4 consecutive
`A` elements should be packed in one 32-bit Tensor Memory word.

The packing format for 4-bit floating point elements in shared memory is to pack two 4-bit
elements in a 8-bit container, with no padding.

##### 9.7.16.10.5. [Data Path Layout Organization](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-organization)[](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-organization "Permalink to this headline")

Different MMA variants access the tensor memory with different layout organization.
The following table lists the various layouts:

| M | cta\_group | A-Sparsity | Is .ws mode | Datapath organization | Layout ID | Tensor Memory Datapath Lane Alignment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 32 | ::1 | Either | Yes | 1x4 | [Layout G](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-g) | 0 |
| 64 | ::1 | Either | Yes | 2x3 | [Layout E](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-e) | 0 |
| 64 | ::1 | Either | No | 4x1 (1/2 datapath utilized) | [Layout F](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-f) | 0 or 16 |
| 128 | ::1 | Either | Either | 4x1 | [Layout D](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-d) | 0 |
| 128 | ::2 | Dense | N/A | 2x2 | [Layout B](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-b) | 0 |
| 128 | ::2 | Sparse | N/A | 4x1 (1/2 datapath utilized) | [Layout C](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-c) | 0 or 16 |
| 256 | ::2 | Either | N/A | 4x1 | [Layout A](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-a) | 0 |

The layouts which utilize only half the datapath lanes, i.e.,
[Layout F](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-f) and
[Layout C](#tcgen05-data-path-layout-c), must use the same Tensor Memory
lane alignment across matrices `A`, `D` and the sparsity metadata matrix.

The following shows the warps that can access the Tensor Memory regions via
`tcgen05.ld` / `tcgen05.st` along with the addresses for various Tensor Memory Layouts.

##### 9.7.16.10.6. [Shared Memory Layout and Swizzling](#tcgen05-shared-memory-layout-swizzling)[](#tcgen05-shared-memory-layout-swizzling "Permalink to this headline")

If the bit `Transpose A Matrix` / `Transpose B Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 0, then *K-major* is
used for matrix `A` / `B` respectively. If the bit `Transpose A Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 1 then *M-major* is
used for matrix `A`. If the bit `Transpose B Matrix` in the
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor) is 1, then *N-major* is
used for matrix `B`.

In a column-major default BLAS library such as cuBLAS, the matrices `A` and `B` with and
without transpose can be classified as either *K-Major* or *M-or-N-Major* as shown in the
following table:

|  | Non-Transposed | Transposed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | K-major | M-major |
| B | K-major | N-major |

To avoid confusion with `A`, `B`, `row-major`, `col-major`, `transpose`, and
`non-transpose`, we will use *MN-Major* and *K-Major* throughout this section.

The matrices in the shared memory are made up of one or more “swizzle layout atom”.
The exact layout of these swizzle atoms depends on the swizzling mode, swizzle-atomicity,
and the leading dimension. The layout of the swizzle are shown in
[Table 53](#tcgen05-smem-swizzle-mode)

Table 53 Layout for swizzle atoms[](#tcgen05-smem-swizzle-mode "Permalink to this table")





| Swizzling mode and Swizzle-Atomicity | Leading Dimension | Swizzle atom layout (128b element) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 128B Swizzling with 32B atomicity | M/N | 8x4 |
| – | – |
| 128B Swizzling with 16B atomicity | M/N | 8x8 |
| K | 8x8 |
| 64B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 4x8 |
| K | 8x4 |
| 32B Swizzling Mode | M/N | 2x8 |
| K | 8x2 |
| None | M/N | 1x8 |
| K | 8x1 |

The above shapes are for elements of size 128 bits. For smaller element sizes, the same shapes
would get multiplied along the leading dimension by a factor of `128 / sizeof_bits(Element)`.
For example, 128B MN major swizzle atom would have a shape of (8\*(128/32))x8 = 32x8 for
tf32 tensor core inputs.

Some example Layouts of *MxK* or *KxN* matrices with various swizzling modes, and are in units
of 128b elements as shown by each colored cell as shown in

##### 9.7.16.10.7. [Block Scaling](#tcgen05-block-scaling)[](#tcgen05-block-scaling "Permalink to this headline")

The `tcgen05.mma` instructions with the following `.kind` qualifier:

* `.kind::mxf8f6f4`
* `.kind::mxf4`
* `.kind::mxf4nvf4`

perform matrix multiplication with block scaling. This operation has the following form:

`(A * scale_A)  * (B * scale_B) + D`

where `scale_A` and `scale_B` are matrices residing in [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory).

For a `scale_A` matrix of shape *M x SFA\_N*, each row of matrix `A` is divided into
*SFA\_N* number of chunks and each chunk of a row is multiplied with the corresponding
element in the *SF\_A* of the same row.

Similarly, for a `scale_B` matrix of shape *SFB\_M x N*, each column of matrix `B` is
divided into the *SFB\_M* number of chunks and each chunk of a column is multiplied with
the corresponding element in the *SF\_B* of the same column.

Scale factors for `A` and `B` matrices need to be duplicated to all 32 lane partitions
of tensor memory.

[Figure 230](#tcgen05-mma-block-scaling) shows an example of `tcgen05.mma` with block scaling of
`scale_vec::2X`.

##### 9.7.16.10.8. [Sparse Matrices](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices)[](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices "Permalink to this headline")

This instruction `tcgen05.mma.sp` can be used when the matrix `A` is a structured
sparse matrix with 50% zeros in each row distributed as per its sparse granularity.

In a *MxNxK* sparse `tcgen05.mma.sp` operation, the matrix `A` of shape *MxK* is
stored in a packed form as *Mx(K/2)* in memory. For each *K-wide* row of matrix `A`,
50% of elements are zeros and the remaining *K/2* non-zero elements are stored in
memory. The metadata specifies the mapping of the *K/2* non-zero elements to the *K*
elements before performing the MMA operation.

Granularity of sparse matrix `A` is defined as the ratio of the number of non-zero
elements in a sub-chunk of the matrix row to the total number of elements in that
sub-chunk where the size of the sub-chunk is shape-specific. The following table lists
the granularity of different `tcgen05.mma.sp` variants:

| .kind of tcgen05.mma | Sparse Granularity |
| --- | --- |
| `.kind::tf32` | 1:2 |
| `.kind::f16` | 2:4 |
| `.kind::f8f6f4` |
| `.kind::mxf8f6f4` |
| `.kind::i8` |
| `.kind::mxf4` | 4:8 (in pairs) |

###### 9.7.16.10.8.1. [Sparse `tcgen05.mma.sp` with `.kind::tf32`](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices-kind-tf32)[](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices-kind-tf32 "Permalink to this headline")

For `.kind::tf32`, matrix `A` is structured sparse at a granularity of `1:2`.
In other words, each chunk of two adjacent elements in a row of matrix `A` has one
zero and one non-zero element. Only the non-zero element is stored in memory and the
4-bit index in the metadata indicates the position of the non-zero element in the
two-wide chunk. The only meaningful values of the index are:

* `0b1110`
* `0b0100`

Rest of the values result in undefined behavior.

For the following `.kind` variants of `tcgen05.mma`:

* `.kind::f16`
* `.kind::f8f8f4`
* `.kind::mxf8f6f4`
* `.kind::i8`

matrix `A` is structured sparse at a granularity of `2:4`. In other words, each chunk
of four adjacent elements in a row of matrix `A` has two zero and two non-zero elements.
Only the non-zero elements are stored in memory and the two 2-bit indices in the metadata
indicates the position of the two non-zero elements in the four-wide chunk. The only
meaningful values of the index are:

* `0b0100`

For `.kind::mxf4` and `.kind::mxf4nvf4`, matrix `A` is pair-wise structured
sparse at a granularity of `4:8`. In other words, each chunk of eight adjacent
elements in a row of matrix `A` has four zero and four non-zero elements. The
zero and non-zero elements are clustered in sub-chunks of two elements each within
the eight-wide chunk, so each two-wide sub-chunk within the eight-wide chunk must be
all zeros or all non-zeros. Only the four non-zero elements are stored in memory and
the two 2-bit indices in the metadata indicates the position of the two two-wide
sub-chunks with non-zero values in the eight-wide chunk of a row of matrix `A`.
The only meaningful values of the index are:

* `0b0100`
* `0b1000`
* `0b1100`
* `0b1001`
* `0b1101`

Description

Instruction `tcgen05.mma` is an asynchronous instruction which initiates an *MxNxK* matrix
multiply and accumulate operation,
`D = A*B+D`
where the `A` matrix is *MxK*, the `B` matrix is *KxN*, and the `D` matrix is *MxN*.

The operation of the form
`D = A*B`
is issued when the input predicate argument `enable-input-d` is false.

The optional immediate argument `scale-input-d` can be specified to scale the input
matrix `D` as follows:
`D = A*B+D * (2 ^ - scale-input-d)`

The valid range of values for argument `scale-input-d` is [0, 15]. The argument
`scale-input-d` is only valid for `.kind::tf32` and `.kind::f16`.

The 32-bit register operand `idesc` is the instruction descriptor as described
in [Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor), specifies
the shapes, exact types, sparsity and other details of the input matrices,
output matrix and the matrix multiply and accumulate operation.

The qualifier `.cta_group::1` specifies that the matrix multiply and
accumulate operation is performed on the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) of the
executing thread’s CTA only. The qualifier `.cta_group::2` specifies that the matrix
multiply and accumulate operation is performed on the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory)
of the executing thread’s CTA and its [peer CTA](#tcgen05-peer-cta).

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

The instruction `tcgen05.mma` has single thread semantics, unlike the collective
instructions `mma.sync` or `wgmma.mma_async`. So, a single thread issuing the
`tcgen05.mma` will result in the initiation of the whole matrix multiply and
accumulate operation. Refer to the section [Issue Granularity](#tcgen05-issue-granularity).

The qualifier `.kind` specifies the general kind of the element types of the multiplicand
matrices. The exact types of the elements of the input and output matrices for each MMA-kind
are specified in the [Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor).

The address operand `d-tmem` specifies the address of the destination and the accumulation
matrix `D` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The address operand `a-tmem`
specifies the address of the matrix `A` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory).
The 64-bit register operand `a-desc` and `b-desc` are the matrix descriptors which
represent the matrices `A` and `B` in shared memory respectively. The format of the
matrix descriptor is described in [Matrix Descriptors](#tcgen05-matrix-descriptors).

The vector operand `disable-output-lane` specifies the lane(s) in the
[Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) that should be not be updated with the resultant
matrix `D`. Elements of the vector operand `disable-output-lane` forms a mask where
each bit corresponds to a lane of the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory), with least
significant bit of the first element of the vector (leftmost in syntax) corresponding
to the lane 0 of the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). If a bit in the mask is 1,
then the corresponding lane in the Tensor Memory for the resultant matrix `D` will not
be updated. The size of the vector is as follows:

| .cta\_group | Size of the vector disable-output-lane |
| --- | --- |
| ::1 | 4 |
| ::2 | 8 |

Qualifier `.block_scale` specifies that the matrices `A` and `B` are scaled with
`scale_A` and `scale_B` matrices respectively before performing the matrix multiply
and accumulate operation as specified in the section [Block Scaling](#tcgen05-block-scaling).
The address operand `scale-A-tmem` and `scale-B-tmem` specify the base address the
matrices `scale_A` and `scale_B` respectively in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory).

For qualifier `.scale_vectorsize`,

* If `.scale_vec::NX` is specified: N specifies the number of columns in `scale_A`
  matrix and number of rows in `scale_B` matrix.
* If `.blockN` is specified: N specifies the block size for which single scale factor
  will be applied. In this form, value of N is same as the K-dimension / (N of `.scale_vec::NX`).

Aliased `.scale_vectorsize` variants:

1. `.block16` is aliased with:

   1. `.scale_vec::4X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf4nvf4` and K = 64 or 128
2. `.block32` is aliased with:

   1. `.scale_vec::1X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf8f6f4` for all supported values of K
   2. `.scale_vec::2X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf4` or `.kind::mxf4nvf4` and K = 64 or 128

The valid combinations of MMA-kind and `.scale_vectorsize` are
described in [Table 54](#tcgen05-mma-scale-valid-comb). For `.kind::mxf4` when the qualifier
`.scale_vectorsize` is not specified, then it defaults to `.block32`. For `.kind::mxf4nvf4`,
the qualifier `.scale_vectorsize` must be explicitly specified.

The qualifier `.ashift` shifts the rows of the `A` matrix down by one row, except for
the last row in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). Qualifier `.ashift` is only allowed
with *M* = 128 or *M* = 256.

The qualifier `.collector_usage` specifies the usage of collector buffer for matrix `A`.
Following collector buffer operations can be specified:

| .collector\_usage | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `.collector::a::fill` | Specifies that the `A` matrix read from the memory should be filled in collector buffer. |
| `.collector::a::use` | Specifies that the `A` matrix can be read from the collector buffer. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer to be still valid. |
| `.collector::a::lastuse` | Specifies that the `A` matrix can be read from the collector buffer and the contents of the collector buffer can be discarded. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer to be valid till the collector buffer is read. |
| `.collector::a::discard` | Specifies that the contents of the collector buffer for `A` can be discarded. |

If no `.collector_usage` qualifier is specified, then it defaults to `.collector::a::discard`.
It is illegal to specify either of `.collector::a::use` or `.collector::a::fill` along with
`.ashift`.

Description

Instruction `tcgen05.mma.sp` is an asynchronous instruction which initiates an
*MxNxK* matrix multiply and accumulate operation of the form
`D = A*B+D`
where the `A` matrix is *Mx(K/2)*, the `B` matrix is *KxN*, and the `D` matrix is *MxN*.
[Sparse Matrices](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices) describes the details of the sparsity.

The operation of the form
`D = A*B`
is issued when the input predicate argument `enable-input-d` is false.

The optional immediate argument `scale-input-d` can be specified to scale the
input matrix `D` as follows:
`D = A*B+D * (2 ^ - scale-input-d)`

The valid range of values for argument `scale-input-d` is [0, 15]. The argument
`scale-input-d` is only valid for `.kind::tf32` and `.kind::f16`.

The 32-bit register operand `idesc` is the instruction descriptor as described in
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor), specifies the shapes,
exact types, sparsity and other details of the input matrices, output matrix and the
matrix multiply and accumulate operation.

The qualifier `.cta_group::1` specifies that the matrix multiply and accumulate
operation is performed on the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) of the executing
thread’s CTA only. The qualifier `.cta_group::2` specifies that the matrix
multiply and accumulate operation is performed on the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory)
of the executing thread’s CTA and its [peer CTA](#tcgen05-peer-cta).

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

The instruction `tcgen05.mma.sp` has single thread semantics, unlike the collective
instructions `mma.sync` or `wgmma.mma_async`. So, a single thread issuing the
`tcgen05.mma.sp` will result in the initiation of the whole matrix multiply and
accumulate operation. Refer to the section [Issue Granularity](#tcgen05-issue-granularity).

The qualifier `.kind` specifies the general kind of the element types of the multiplicand
matrices. The exact types of the elements of the input and output matrices for each MMA-kind
are specified in the [Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor).

The address operand `d-tmem` specifies the address of the destination and the accumulation
matrix `D` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The address operand `a-tmem`
specifies the address of the matrix `A` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The
64-bit register operand `a-desc` and `b-desc` are the matrix descriptors which represent
the matrices `A` and `B` in shared memory respectively. The format of the matrix descriptor
is described in [Matrix Descriptors](#tcgen05-matrix-descriptors).

The vector operand `disable-output-lane` specifies the lane(s) in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory)
that should be not be updated with the resultant matrix `D`. Elements of the vector operand
`disable-output-lane` forms a mask where each bit corresponds to a lane of the
[Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). with least significant bit of the first element of
the vector (leftmost in syntax) corresponding to the lane 0 of the Tensor Memory. If a bit in
the mask is 1, then the corresponding lane in the Tensor Memory for the resultant matrix `D`
will not be updated. The size of the vector is as follows:

| .cta\_group | Size of the vector disable-output-lane |
| --- | --- |
| ::1 | 4 |
| ::2 | 8 |

Qualifier `.block_scale` specifies that the matrices `A` and `B` are scaled with
`scale_A` and `scale_B` matrices respectively before performing the matrix multiply
and accumulate operation as specified in the section [Block Scaling](#tcgen05-block-scaling).
The address operand `scale-A-tmem` and `scale-B-tmem` specify the base address the
matrices `scale_A` and `scale_B` respectively in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory).

For qualifier `.scale_vectorsize`,

* If `.scale_vec::NX` is specified: N specifies the number of columns in `scale_A`
  matrix and number of rows in `scale_B` matrix.
* If `.blockN` is specified: N specifies the block size for which single scale factor
  will be applied. In this form, value of N is same as the K-dimension / (N of `.scale_vec::NX`).

Aliased `.scale_vectorsize` variants:

1. `.block16` is aliased with:

   1. `.scale_vec::4X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf4nvf4` and K = 64 or 128
2. `.block32` is aliased with:

   1. `.scale_vec::1X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf8f6f4` for all supported values of K
   2. `.scale_vec::2X` when `.kind = .kind::mxf4` or `.kind::mxf4nvf4` and K = 64 or 128

The valid combinations of MMA-kind and `.scale_vectorsize` are
described in [Table 54](#tcgen05-mma-scale-valid-comb). For `.kind::mxf4` when the qualifier
`.scale_vectorsize` is not specified, then it defaults to `.block32`. For `.kind::mxf4nvf4`,
the qualifier `.scale_vectorsize` must be explicitly specified.

The qualifier `.ashift` shifts the rows of the `A` matrix down by one row, except for
the last row in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). Qualifier `.ashift` is only allowed
with *M* = 128 or *M* = 256.

The qualifier `.collector_usage` specifies the usage of collector buffer for matrix `A`.
Following collector buffer operations can be specified:

| .collector\_usage | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `.collector::a::fill` | Specifies that the `A` matrix read from the memory should be filled in collector buffer. |
| `.collector::a::use` | Specifies that the `A` matrix can be read from the collector buffer. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer to be still valid. |
| `.collector::a::lastuse` | Specifies that the `A` matrix can be read from the collector buffer and the contents of the collector buffer can be discarded. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer to be valid till the collector buffer is read. |
| `.collector::a::discard` | Specifies that the contents of the collector buffer for `A` can be discarded. |

If no `.collector_usage` qualifier is specified, then it defaults to `.collector::a::discard`.
It is illegal to specify either of `.collector::a::use` or `.collector::a::fill` along with
`.ashift`.

Description

Instruction `tcgen05.mma.ws` is an asynchronous instruction which initiates an *MxNxK*
matrix multiply and accumulate operation,
`D = A*B+D`
where the `A` matrix is *MxK*, the `B` matrix is *KxN*, and the `D` matrix is *MxN*.

The operation of the form
`D = A*B`
is issued when the input predicate argument `enable-input-d` is false.

The 32-bit register operand `idesc` is the instruction descriptor as described in
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor), specifies the shapes, exact
types, sparsity and other details of the input matrices, output matrix and the matrix
multiply and accumulate operation.

The qualifier `.cta_group::1` specifies that the matrix multiply and accumulate operation
is performed on the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory) of the executing thread’s CTA only.

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

The instruction `tcgen05.mma.ws` has single thread semantics, unlike the collective
instructions `mma.sync` or `wgmma.mma_async`. So, a single thread issuing the
`tcgen05.mma.ws` will result in the initiation of the whole matrix multiply and accumulate
operation. Refer to the section [Issue Granularity](#tcgen05-issue-granularity).

The qualifier `.kind` specifies the general kind of the element types of the multiplicand
matrices. The exact types of the elements of the input and output matrices for each MMA-kind
are specified in the [Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor).

The address operand `d-tmem` specifies the address of the destination and the accumulation
matrix `D` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The address operand `a-tmem`
specifies the address of the matrix `A` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The
64-bit register operand `a-desc` and `b-desc` are the matrix descriptors which represent
the matrices `A` and `B` in shared memory respectively. The format of the matrix descriptor
is described in [Matrix Descriptors](#tcgen05-matrix-descriptors).

The optional operand `zero-column-mask-desc` is a 64-bit register which specifies the
[Zero-Column Mask Descriptor](#tcgen05-zero-column-mask-descriptor). The zero-column
mask descriptor is used to generate a mask that specifies which columns of `B` matrix
will have zero value for the matrix multiply and accumulate operation regardless of the
values present in the shared memory.

The qualifier `.collector_usage` specifies the usage of collector buffer for Matrix `B`.
Following collector buffer operations can be specified:

| .collector\_usage | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `.collector::bN::fill` | Specifies that the `B` matrix read from the memory should be filled in collector buffer #N. |
| `.collector::bN::use` | Specifies that the `B` matrix can be read from the collector buffer #N. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer #N to be still valid. |
| `.collector::bN::lastuse` | Specifies that the `B` matrix can be read from the collector buffer #N after which the contents of the collector buffer #N can be discarded. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer #N to be valid till the collector buffer #N is read. |
| `.collector::bN::discard` | Specifies that the contents of the collector buffer #N can be discarded. |

If no `.collector_usage` qualifier is specified, then it defaults to `.collector::b0::discard`.

Description

Instruction `tcgen05.mma.ws.sp` is an asynchronous instruction which initiates
an *MxNxK* matrix multiply and accumulate operation,
`D = A*B+D`
where the `A` matrix is *Mx(K/2)*, the `B` matrix is *KxN*, and the `D` matrix
is *MxN*. [Sparse Matrices](#tcgen05-sparse-matrices) describes the details of the
sparsity.

The operation of the form
`D = A*B`
is issued when the input predicate argument `enable-input-d` is false.

The 32-bit register operand `idesc` is the instruction descriptor as described in
[Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor), specifies the shapes, exact
types, sparsity and other details of the input matrices, output matrix and the matrix
multiply and accumulate operation.

The qualifier `.cta_group::1` specifies that the matrix multiply and accumulate
operation is performed on the Tensor Memory of the executing thread’s CTA only.

All `tcgen05` instructions within a kernel must specify the same value for the `.cta_group`
qualifier.

The instruction `tcgen05.mma.ws.sp` has single thread semantics, unlike the collective
instructions `mma.sync` or `wgmma.mma_async`. So, a single thread issuing the
`tcgen05.mma.ws.sp` will result in the initiation of the whole matrix multiply and
accumulate operation. Refer to the section [Issue Granularity](#tcgen05-issue-granularity).

The qualifier `.kind` specifies the general kind of the element types of the multiplicand
matrices. The exact types of the elements of the input and output matrices for each MMA-kind are
specified in the [Instruction descriptor](#tcgen05-instruction-descriptor).

The address operand `d-tmem` specifies the address of the destination and the accumulation
matrix `D` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The address operand `a-tmem` specifies
the address of the matrix `A` in the [Tensor Memory](#tensor-memory). The 64-bit register
operand `a-desc` and `b-desc` are the matrix descriptors which represent the matrices `A`
and `B` in shared memory respectively. The format of the matrix descriptor is described in
[Matrix Descriptors](#tcgen05-matrix-descriptors).

The optional operand `zero-column-mask-desc` is a 64-bit register which specifies the
[Zero-Column Mask Descriptor](#tcgen05-zero-column-mask-descriptor). The zero-column
mask descriptor is used to generate a mask that specifies which columns of `B` matrix
will have zero value for the matrix multiply and accumulate operation regardless of the
values present in the shared memory.

The qualifier `.collector_usage` specifies the usage of collector buffer for Matrix `B`.
Following collector buffer operations can be specified:

| .collector\_usage | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `.collector::bN::fill` | Specifies that the `B` matrix read from the memory should be filled in collector buffer #N. |
| `.collector::bN::use` | Specifies that the `B` matrix can be read from the collector buffer #N. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer #N to be still valid. |
| `.collector::bN::lastuse` | Specifies that the `B` matrix can be read from the collector buffer #N after which the contents of the collector buffer #N can be discarded. This requires a previous fill to the collector buffer #N to be valid till the collector buffer #N is read. |
| `.collector::bN::discard` | Specifies that the contents of the collector buffer #N can be discarded. |

If no `.collector_usage` qualifier is specified, then it defaults to `.collector::b0::discard`.
