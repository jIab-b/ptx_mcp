##### 9.7.14.5.5. Matrix Fragments for mma.m8n8k128 

A warp executing `mma.m8n8k128` will compute an MMA operation of shape `.m8n8k128`.

Elements of the matrix are distributed across the threads in a warp so each thread of the warp holds
a fragment of the matrix.

* Multiplicand A:

  | .atype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.b1` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing thirty two `.b1` elements from the matrix A. | a0, a1, … a30, a31 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 62](#mma-88128-a).

  The row and column of a matrix fragment can be computed as:

  ```
  groupID = %laneid >> 2

  threadID_in_group = %laneid % 4



  row = groupID



  col = (threadID_in_group * 32) + i for ai where i = {0,..,31}
  ```
* Multiplicand B:

  | .btype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.b1` | A vector expression containing a single `.b32` register, containing thirty two `.b1` elements from the matrix B. | b0, b1, …, b30, b31 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 63](#mma-88128-b).

  ```
* Accumulators (C or D):

  | .ctype / .dtype | Fragment | Elements (low to high) |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `.s32` | A vector expression containing two `.s32` registers, containing two `.s32` elements from the matrix C (or D). | c0, c1 |

  The layout of the fragments held by different threads is shown in [Figure 64](#mma-88128-c).
